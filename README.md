# homework-03-java


The first thing I did was write a pseudo code/flow chart to describe the algorithm.

Can be found at: https://github.com/MagsBootCamp/homework03-java . It is named pseudo1.jpg

Then I wrote up what var function arrays prompts and confrims and validations using if else that I thought I needed.
The character length was a prompt as it needs the user to choose a unique number between 8 and 128.
The others, numbers, special characters, uppercare and lowercase are confirms as its a yes or no (true or false).



The I've tried to create the if statement to check that the user has entered a number  between 8 and 128 and that it is a number and not text.
If it is not a number the function ends.
If it is a number it continues.

I then needed to construct the password: Thats is telling it that the variable for character length had to be included but for the numbers, special characters, uppercare and lowercase I used "or" as they were optional and decided by user requirements - so true responses are included and false responses to a variable are not. 

Then I needed a function to use the character length, and also generate random numbers for the remaining variables that the user chose to include.

I've now decided to log all of my thinking in the JavaScript file so have not added anymore here, other than to say I ran out of time and did not
get it working perfectly - the length of the password is correct but the user selections for the other characters is not working which I explain in the Java Script file.
Basically I know that I needed to program for "if" the number, special char, upper case, capitals were "true" then they should be called on the generate 
but I couldnt work it out.
I tried by using "if" and then += to a base set but I failed.
